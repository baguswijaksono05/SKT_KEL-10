# üåê Edge Gateway and Integration of DWSIM, Rust Backend, and Cloud ThingsBoard

## üìò Overview
This project presents the design and implementation of an **Edge Gateway System** that integrates:

- **DWSIM** (chemical process simulator)  
- **Rust Backend** (edge and cloud communication handler)  
- **ThingsBoard Cloud Platform** (for visualization and monitoring)  

The integration enables real-time synchronization of process data between simulation, embedded systems, and cloud infrastructure.  
This architecture supports **Digital Twin** and **Industrial IoT (IIoT)** applications by ensuring secure, efficient, and scalable data communication.

## üß© System Architecture
The proposed architecture follows a **Distributed Control System (DCS)** structure, where data is collected from physical sensors and simulation environments, processed at the edge, and visualized in the cloud.

### Components
| Component | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **ESP32-S3** | Acts as the main edge gateway; handles Modbus RS-485 communication, data processing, and MQTT transmission. |
| **SHT20 Sensor** | Measures temperature and humidity via I¬≤C. Compact, low-power, and reliable. |
| **RS-485 Module (MAX485)** | Enables stable serial communication between sensors and the microcontroller using Modbus RTU protocol. |
| **Rust Backend** | Manages secure data processing, MQTT communication, and InfluxDB storage. Optimized for concurrency and memory safety. |
| **InfluxDB** | Time-series database used for logging and analyzing sensor and simulation data. |
| **ThingsBoard** | Cloud IoT platform used for visualization, monitoring, and dashboard management. |
| **DWSIM** | Chemical process simulator that generates virtual process data (temperature, flow, pressure, etc.) to integrate with the real-time system. |
| **Relay & Buzzer** | Actuators for process control and alert indication. |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

### 1. Component Design
The **ESP32-S3** is programmed as an **Edge Gateway** using **Embedded Rust**.  
It connects to sensors (via RS-485 Modbus) and sends processed data to:

- **InfluxDB** ‚Üí for real-time storage  
- **ThingsBoard** ‚Üí for visualization through MQTT  
- **DWSIM Integration** ‚Üí for simulation data synchronization  

### 2. System Design
Data flow involves:
1. Sensor and simulated data acquisition (ESP32-S3, DWSIM, Python scripts)  
2. Processing and filtering by the Rust backend  
3. Real-time visualization in the ThingsBoard dashboard  
4. Historical data stored in InfluxDB for trend analysis and validation  

This ensures **two-way communication** between the physical system and its digital representation.
